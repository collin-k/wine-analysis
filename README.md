# Finding Predictive Indicators for Wine Ratings
* Analysis of predictive indicators for wine ratings

_Note: This analytical project is an extension from my previous assignment from the DATA 11900 Introduction to Data Science course, where my group analyzed factors that influence wine ratings. Upon review, several errors were found in our approach and analysis. With a deeper understanding of  wine, I have refined the research approach and corrected the errors in data cleaning and analysis._
