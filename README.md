# Note

_This analytical project is an extension of my previous assignment from the DATA 11900 Introduction to Data Science course, where my group analyzed factors that influence wine price. Upon review, several errors were found in our approach and analysis. With a deeper understanding of  wine, I have refined the research approach and corrected the errors in data cleaning and analysis._
